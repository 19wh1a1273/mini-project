**FRESHNESS of FRUIT DETECTION USING VGG MODEL

Automation of fruit classification is an interesting application of computer vision. Fruits are good for 
health and we get nutrition. It is a source of vitamins and minerals. Sometimes fruits are rotten in 
the consumer end also the packing end. Due to busy schedule many people are buying fruits which 
are not so fresh and rotten fruits are not good for health. An infected apple may infect a healthy one 
if the defects are not discovered. So, to avoid these rotten fruits we came up with a solution. In 
recent years, computer machine vision and image processing techniques have been found 
increasingly useful in the fruit industry, especially for applications in quality inspection and color, 
size, shape sorting. In the recent advancements of computer vision and deep learning our approach 
is to recognize whether a fruit is fresh or rotten. The fruit recognition systems have become a 
challenging topic in the field of computer vision. Various image analysis techniques have been 
developed to help and facilitate work. We use VGG model for classifying the rotten fruit and fresh 
fruit. It can identify the share of rotten and freshness of fruit by the use of image data


**Problem Definition:**

Development of an Application called “ Freshness of Fruit Detection using VGG model ” which is 
done by determination of fruit freshness by classifying them into fresh or rotten by using a dataset 
which consists of digital images of fresh and rotten apples, bananas, Oranges.

**Aim of the project:**
Aim of the project is to protect the health of the people from such toxic based chemicals which are 
present in fruits. So to avoid these Determination of fruit freshness is done by classifying them into 
fresh or rotten by using a dataset which consists of digital images of fresh and rotten apples, 
bananas, Oranges. We use VGG16 model version for classifying the rotten fruit and fresh fruit. It can 
identify the share of rotten and freshness of fruit by the use of photograph data and give the 
percentage of how much it is fresh or rotten.

Accuracy – 93.1
